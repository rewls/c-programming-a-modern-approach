C   is quirky,   flawed, and an
enormous    success.    Although accidents of    history
surely helped, it evidently satisfied a need

   for a system implementation language  efficient
enough to displace assembly language, asdfasdfasdfasdf
asdfasdfasdfasdfsadfasdfasdfasdf asdfasdfasd
asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf
yet sufficiently abstract and fluent   to   describe
algorithms and interactions in a wide variety
of environments.
Dennis M.    Ritchie
